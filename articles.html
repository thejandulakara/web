                <h2>Tyrannosaurus Rex</h2>
                <p>T. rex is one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs on record. Sue, the most complete T. rex specimen with 90% of its bones accounted for and whose remains reside at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, was likely about 41 feet (12 m) long and about 12.5 feet (3.8 m) tall at the hips, Carr said — although this is an estimate, as a complete T. rex tail has never been found. T. rex adults weighed between an average of 15,266 and 23,037 pounds (6,925 and 10,450 kilograms), according to different studies.

                    The largest T. rex on record is the heavyweight champ known as Scotty, but "it's really marginal," Carr said. "We're talking differences on a scale of inches."
                    
                    Analysis of the  Scotty specimen suggests T. rex had a maximum mass of about 19,555 pounds (8,870 kg), although it's possible that the tyrant king weighed up to 33,000 pounds (15,000 kg), according to research presented at the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology's (SVP) annual meeting in 2022.
                    
                    T. rex wasn't the largest carnivorous dinosaur, however. That honor goes to Spinosaurus, which was probably a few meters longer, Carr said.

                <h2>Velociraptor</h2>
                <p> Velociraptors have been misunderstood ever since they were featured in Jurassic Park as giant scaly dinosaurs that hunted in packs and disemboweled prey with sickle-shaped claws. <br>
                     portrayal got several things wrong. Velociraptors were actually feathered animals. They grew up to 100 pounds, about the size of a wolf.<br>
                      they likely hunted solo—using their claws to clutch rather than slash prey—when they roamed central and eastern Asia between about 74 million and 70 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous period.

                    In fact, the raptors that terrorized Jurassic Park were based on a Velociraptor relative: Deinonychus antirrhopus, a much larger dinosaur that inhabited North America in the early Cretaceous period, about 145 to 100 million years ago.
                    
                    So what were Velociraptors really like? Although our knowledge is still growing as more fossil evidence is unearthed, paleontologists have managed to learn a lot about these iconic predators.

                <h2>Triceratops</h2>
                <p>Triceratops possessed a gigantic skull, and some individuals had skulls nearly 3 metres (about 10 feet) long, which would place them among the largest of all terrestrial animals.<br>
                    addition to its three conspicuous horns, which were placed above each eye and on the snout, it possessed numerous small spikes (epoccipitals) that bordered the margin of the expanded frill of bone at the back of the skull.<br>
                    were as many as 19–26 epoccipitals on the frill. Triceratops also possessed smaller hornlike projections on the jugal bones (cheekbones). <br>
                    upper and lower jaws were lined with stacked columns of teeth, which appear to have been specialized for shearing. The front of the mouth formed a beak, which may have been used to crop vegetation.<br>
                    addition, most of the skull was covered by indentations made by blood vessels; similar indentations are found under the keratinous beaks of living birds. <br>
                    uggests that the dinosaur’s entire head, aside from the cheeks and the area around the nostrils, was covered in keratin while it was alive.<br>
                    many living birds, keratin is very colourful, a fact that suggests that the skulls of Triceratops may have been very colourful as well.
